# Eternal Frost

Created in GameMaker for the GMTK Game Jam 2020

You must journey to the peak of a mountain while finding out about a fallen world and the nature of destiny. Short and to the point. 5-10 minute playtime.

All art, music, coding, and writing was done by me. I wrote the music before the jam.
